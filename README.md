# Simple Unit Testing Framework for `ft_printf`

This project includes a simple unit testing setup for the custom `ft_printf` function using the Unity testing framework. The `ft_printf` function is a reimplementation of the standard C `printf` function with custom behavior.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all `ft_printf` source files and the `Makefile`.
- `test/`: Contains the test file(s) for `ft_printf`.
- `unity/`: Contains the Unity testing framework files, which can be cloned from the Unity repository.

## Cloning Unity

To set up the Unity framework in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity.git unity
```

## Usage

1. Place all your `ft_printf` source files inside the `src/` directory.
2. Clone the Unity framework into the `unity/` directory as shown above.
3. run `make`
